abstract = {A new system for object detection in cluttered RGB-D images is presented. Our main contribution is a new method called Bingham Procrustean Alignment (BPA) to align models with the scene. BPA uses point correspondences between oriented features to derive a probability distribution over possible model poses. The orientation component of this distribution, conditioned on the position, is shown to be a Bingham distribution. This result also applies to the classic problem of least-squares alignment of point sets, when point features are orientation-less, and gives a principled, probabilistic way to measure pose uncertainty in the rigid alignment problem. Our detection system leverages BPA to achieve more reliable object detections in clutter.},

We validate the architecture through a series of experiments, in which a human demonstrator teaches a humanoid robot simple manipulatory tasks. A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixture model). This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression. Finally, we analytically compute the trajectory which optimizes the imitation metric and use this to generalize the skill to different contexts.},

abstract = {In several multitarget tracking applications, a target may return more than one measurement per target and interacting targets may return multiple merged measurements between targets. Existing algorithms for tracking and data association, initially applied to radar tracking, do not adequately address these types of measurements. Here, we introduce a probabilistic model for interacting targets that addresses both types of measurements simultaneously. We provide an algorithm for approximate inference in this model using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based auxiliary variable particle filter. We Rao-Blackwellize the Markov chain to eliminate sampling over the continuous state space of the targets. A major contribution of this work is the use of sparse least squares updating and downdating techniques, which significantly reduce the computational cost per iteration of the Markov chain. Also, when combined with a simple heuristic, they enable the algorithm to correctly focus computation on interacting targets. We include experimental results on a challenging simulation sequence. We test the accuracy of the algorithm using two sensor modalities, video, and laser range data. We also show the algorithm exhibits real time performance on a conventional PC.},

abstract = {We describe a particle filter that effectively deals with interacting targets--targets that are influenced by the proximity and/or behavior of other targets. The particle filter includes a Markov random field (MRF) motion prior that helps maintain the identity of targets throughout an interaction, significantly reducing tracker failures. We show that this MRF prior can be easily implemented by including an additional interaction factor in the importance weights of the particle filter. However, the computational requirements of the resulting multitarget filter render it unusable for large numbers of targets. Consequently, we replace the traditional importance sampling step in the particle filter with a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step to obtain a more efficient MCMC-based multitarget filter. We also show how to extend this MCMC-based filter to address a variable number of interacting targets. Finally, we present both qualitative and quantitative experimental results, demonstrating that the resulting particle filters deal efficiently and effectively with complicated target interactions.},
